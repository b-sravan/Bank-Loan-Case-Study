# Bank Loan Analysis Project

## Project Overview

As a team member in a consumer finance company, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in loan application data. The primary objective was to ensure loans are provided to applicants capable of repayment, minimizing the risk of default.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed irrelevant columns and outliers for accurate analysis.
   - Handled missing data, replacing blank values with appropriate categorical variables and median values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Utilized pivot tables, charts, and outlier analysis to identify factors influencing loan repayment.
   - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data patterns and correlations.

3. **Insights and Outliers:**
   - Identified highest occurring categorical variables in various columns.
   - Addressed outliers in key columns like AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE, and Amt credit.

4. **Data Imbalance Analysis:**
   - Utilized Pivot charts to visualize data imbalance, a crucial aspect in understanding data dissemination.

## Technologies Used

## Summary and Conclusions

- Highly recommended loan groups include previous application approved clients, married individuals, senior clients, more educated clients, high-income customers, and customers with strong work experience.
- High-risk loan groups consist of unemployed individuals, youth clients, customers with previously denied applications, low-income customers, individuals with insufficient external sources, customers with little work experience, customers on maternity leave, and customers with larger family sizes.
